It is an amazon.in clone by using HTML and CSS 


(HTML, CSS) Based Project
Amazon (Clone) Project Learnings â€“

1)	CDN (Content Delivery Network) helps us to connect with the nearest Server to fetch the libraries which are going to use in our project. 
Example:   font-awesome site which is used to keep icons in our projects.
By the help of cdn font-awesome we can add the required libraries of font-awesome from the nearest server.
2)	If we want to create a div in our project than we can use dot (.) directly with the help of dot vs code create a div with class attribute in our project.

3)	Background size:  cover -> It means if you make a div and you want to insert an image inside that div then cover helps us to keep an image in whole div without any padding and margin. 

4)	Justify-content: center -> Set the items in the middle according horizontally but it works only on flex-box container.

5)	Align-items: center -> Set the items in the middle according Vertically but it works only on flex-box container.

6)	Background-image-repeat: no repeat means it does not allow to repeat a single image for multiple time inside a single div. 

7)	If we make a display blog it means all the items inside that class arrange vertically and if we want to do opposite of this then we have to make a class display-flex

8)	Flex-wrap: wrap means arrange a same type of box one under another. Means in a horizontal row 

9)	Font-weight helps us to make a text darker.

Most Important: last but not the least if you want to make any website from scratch then you have to use these lines of code add initially inside your CSS file. Because it helps us to keep our site responsive.
